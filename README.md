# Mobiquitytestng8
This is my solution for [Mobiquity's](https://www.mobiquity.com/) code test.
This project was done with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

A running solution can be found on my [http://biolaakinsanmi.com/f1champions/](http://biolaakinsanmi.com/f1champions/).

## Task
We will use [http://ergast.com/mrd/](http://ergast.com/mrd/) to create a single page application that
presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until
2015. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the
selected year. We also request to highlight the row when the winner has
been the world champion in the same season.

You can adjust the UI how you see fit for the best result, but sticking to a
single page application is mandatory. We would prefer if you will deliver the
code using GitHub/BitBucket (make sure we can share it amongst multiple
people).

## Run on Development server

Change directory into Project folder. Run `npm install` to insall required packages.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Coverage can be viewed by launching the `coverage\mobiquitytestng8\index.html` file.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
